Learning how to work better with designers and engineers through wireframing and vibecoding, conducting hundreds of user interviews and discovery across tons of industries, and pitching our idea to investors and VCs is a small part of what I do to help the community thrive.',

      'I built Lumen, an AI-powered platform that helps product and UX teams truly understand their users.',
      'At many companies, I saw the same challenge come up again and again. Feedback was scattered across support tickets, app reviews, social media, and community forums, which made it incredibly hard to find the insights that mattered. With Lumen, I set out to fix that.',
      'The platform collects feedback from different channels, organizes it with AI, and highlights the themes that are most important. Teams can easily spot what users need, discover new feature requests, and search across all feedback to answer product questions quickly. Lumen makes it simple to cut through the noise and turn user voices into clear direction for building better products.'
